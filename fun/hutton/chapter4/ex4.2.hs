2. Consider a function safetail :: [a ] â†’ [a ] that behaves as the library
function tail , except that safetail maps the empty list to itself, whereas
tail produces an error in this case. Define safetail using:
   (a) a conditional expression;
   (b) guarded equations;
   (c) pattern matching.
Hint: make use of the library function null.

safetail xs = if null xs then [] else tail xs

--(b) guarded equations;

safetail' :: [a] -> [a]
safetail' xs |null xs = []
             |otherwise = tail xs

--(c) pattern matching.
safetail'' :: [a] -> [a]
safetail'' [] = []
safetail'' (_:xs) = xs
